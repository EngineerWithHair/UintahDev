The View Widget consists of an eye point, a ``look at'' point,
and an up point (encompassing the up vector and the field of
view) as shown in figure~\ref{fig:ViewDesign}.  There is also
a geometric representation of the viewing frustrum defined by
the interface components.  The primary use of the View Widget is
to specify a camera view from within the data space---this is
useful for producing animations and for better understanding
and defining a view which is then shown in another window.

The user can independently adjust the eye point, the up
vector, the field of view, the front clipping plane, and the
back clipping plane (also the ``look at'' point).
