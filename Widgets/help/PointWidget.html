The Point Widget consists of a sphere as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:PointDesign}.  The primary use of the Point
Widget is for specifying the seedpoint of a single streamline.
It can also be used for selecting a 3D coordinate for further
operations, but we recommend that the Crosshair Widget be used
for that purpose.  (Note: the Point Widget requires no
constraints.)

The user moves the Point Widget by dragging it.
