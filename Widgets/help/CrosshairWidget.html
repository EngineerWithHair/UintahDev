The Crosshair Widget consists of the Point Widget with a
cylindrical axis along three orthogonal directions as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:CrosshairDesign}.  The primary use of the
Crosshair Widget is to select a coordinate in a cluttered
space.  We consider a cluttered space to be one where it may
be overly difficult for the user to select a Point Widget due
to occlusion.  Also, the Crosshair Widget may be used to
select objects in space (such as mesh elements), so the center
of the widget would be hidden inside the selected object.
(Note: the Crosshair Widget requires no constraints.)

The sphere or cylinders may be dragged to relocate the point.
The widget tends to move along the three axes.
