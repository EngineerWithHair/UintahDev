The Frame Widget consists of four cylinders connected in a
rectangular arrangement as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:FrameDesign}.  In the middle of each of the
cylinders there is a sphere.  There is a resize cylinder
extending from each sphere.  The primary uses of the Frame
Widget are for stream volumes, for image plane definition, and
as a ``tie dye'' as with the Ring Widget above.

If the user drags a sphere, the widget is rotated about its
center without changing the position of the center.  If a
resize cylinder is changed, the appropriate side of the Frame
Widget will be extended without changing orientation.  If a
cylinder is dragged, the entire widget moves without changing
its orientation.
