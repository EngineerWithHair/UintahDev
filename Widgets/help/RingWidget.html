The Ring Widget consists of a torus with four spheres in a
square arrangement with a short cylindrical ``slider'' on the
torus as shown in figure~\ref{fig:RingDesign}.  There are
resize cylinders extending from each sphere.  One of the
resize cylinders has the special material property to indicate
that it is the ``halfway point'' for the slider.  The primary
use of the Ring Widget is to set the density of streamlines
emerging from its torus.  It may also be used as a 3D angle
gauge, as a source for multiple streamlines throughout its
surface, as a source for a stream surface from the outer ring,
and as a source for a stream volume.  Another use is as a color
sheet, or ``tie dye'', where the surface is colored as a
function of the scalar value of the field at each point.

The ``slider'' cylinder may be dragged along the torus, but
not off of it.  The spheres may be dragged to control the
orientation of the Ring Widget.  The resize cylinders may be
dragged to increase the radius of the Ring Widget about its
center.  The torus may be dragged to move the widget without
changing its radius or orientation.
