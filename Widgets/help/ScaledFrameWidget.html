The ScaledFrame Widget consists of the Frame Widget with a
short cylindrical ``slider'' on two of the four long
cylindrical sides as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:ScaledFrameDesign}.  These two sides are
orthogonal.  The primary use of the ScaledFrame Widget is to
set the $u$ and $v$ densities of streamlines emerging from its
edges or from throughout its surface.

The new ``slider'' cylinders may be dragged along the
cylindrical sides, but not off of them or past their ends.
The distances along the cylindrical sides is then used to get
the densities.  The rest is as on the Frame Widget.
