The Gauge Widget consists of two spheres connected by a
cylinder with a small cylindrical ``slider'' on the longer
cylinder as shown in figure~\ref{fig:GaugeDesign}.  There are
also small ``resize'' cylinders extending from the spheres.
The primary use of the Gauge Widget is to set the density of
streamlines emerging from the long cylinder.  It may also be
used as a 3D ``slider'' or as a source for a stream surface.

If either sphere is dragged, the other sphere is dragged along
to maintain the length of the gauge.  If the ``slider''
cylinder is dragged, it cannot move off of the long cylinder
or past its ends.  The distance ratio of the ``slider'' along
the long cylinder is used to compute density.  If the long
cylinder is dragged, the whole widget moves, maintaining their
relative placements.  Finally, if either of the resize
cylinders is dragged, the length and the small cylinder moves
to stay on the long cylinder and to maintain its previous
distance ratio along the long cylinder
