The Path Widget is composed of a spline or hermite curve and
several sub-widget ``control points'' as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:PathDesign} (the ``spline'' in the figure is
simulated by cylinders).  The control points consist of a
sphere, an arrow for the tangent (for hermite curves), and two
arrows which define the ``look at'' and ``up'' directions for
an object at that point on the path.  The primary use of the
View Widget is to create either a spline curve or a hermite
curve.  If this curve is to be used as a path (such as for an
animation sequence), then the user may control the orientation
of the object (or camera) at each control point on the path.
If the user is creating a spline, then the tangent at each
control point is unnecessary, so they may be turned off by
changing Modes (see below).  The same is true if the
orientation is not needed.

The user may drag any arrow about its associated sphere, but
the distance will remain constrained.  The two orientation
arrows will maintain their orthogonality throughout
manipulation by the user.  A control point sub-widget may be
moved by dragging its sphere.  Finally, the entire widget may
be dragged by its spline.
