The ScaledBox Widget consists of the Box Widget with a short
cylindrical ``slider'' on three of the twelve long cylindrical
sides as shown in figure~\ref{fig:ScaledBoxDesign}.  These
three sides are orthogonal.  The primary use of the Scaled Box
Widget is to set the $u$, $v$, and $w$ densities of vector arrows
within its interior.  When the widget is used in this manner
it is referred to as a ``hedgehog.''

The new ``slider'' cylinders may be dragged along the
cylindrical sides, but not off of them or past their ends.
The distances along the cylindrical sides is then used to get
the densities.  The rest is as on the Box Widget.
