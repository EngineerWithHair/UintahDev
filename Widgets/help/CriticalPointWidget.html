The CriticalPoint Widget consists of the Arrow Widget with
additional geometry representing the type of critical point
(regular, attracting node, repelling node, saddle, attracting
focus, repelling focus, or spiral saddle) as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:CriticalPointDesign}.  The primary use of the
CriticalPoint Widget is to investigate a vector field for
critical points, where the geometry will indicate the type of
the closest critical point, and the arrow will point toward
that critical point.  Several instances of this widget may be
used in a non-interactive mode to simply mark critical points
with a geometric indicator.  (Note: the CriticalPoint Widget
requires no constraints.)

The user moves the CriticalPoint Widget by dragging any of its
graphical components.
