\subsection{Tool Widget}

The Tool Widget consists of arbitrary geometry which is
provided by some external agent.  The primary use of the Tool
Widget is in surgical simulation, where simulated tools such
as a scalpel, a laser, and suction will be needed.  (Note: the
Tool Widget requires no constraints.)

The user moves the Tool Widget by dragging any of its
graphical components and setting an orientation.  The six
degrees of freedom will frequently be provided by a ``flying
mouse.''
