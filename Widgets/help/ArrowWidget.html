The Arrow Widget consists of a sphere with a cylinder
extending from it as shown in figure~\ref{fig:ArrowDesign}.
At the end of the cylinder is a cone.  The primary use of the
Arrow Widget is for specifying the seedpoint of an isosurface
growing algorithm, where the arrow will be pointed along the
normal to the isosurface at that point and the length of the
arrow could indicate curvature of the isosurface.  (Note: the
Arrow Widget requires no constraints.)

The user moves the Arrow Widget by dragging any of its
graphical components.
