 * Provides a recursive <b>Mut</b>ual <b>Ex</b>clusion primitive.  Atomic
 * <b>lock()</b> and <b>unlock()</b> will lock and unlock the mutex.
 * Nested calls to <b>lock()</b> by the same thread are acceptable,
 * but must be matched with calls to <b>unlock()</b>.  This class
 * may be less efficient that the <b>Mutex</b> class, and should not
 * be used unless the recursive lock feature is really required.
