   <title>Specification Procedure</title>
</head>
<body>

<center>
<h2>
Specification procedure</h2></center>

<p><br>Our goal is to have complete specifications for each module we release.
To achieve this goal you will need to create and completely populate a
spec.xml file that lives next to the .cc file associated with a module.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>spec.xml</b></dt>

<dd>
Combined with the documentation extracted via Cocoon, spec.xml defines
a complete specification for a module. It contains information the compile
needs, as well as various levels of documentation targeted at different
user levels. spec.xml Documentation will be extracted from spec.xml, it
is intended to be maintained just as the C++ code is.</dd>

<h3>
User levels</h3>

<dt>
<b>user</b></dt>

<dd>
User who works with a predefined network map of modules. This level is
not relevant for module level specifications. They will have a unique user
guide for relevant to the network they use.</dd>

<dt>
<b>builder</b></dt>

<dd>
User will do the above as well as building and editing their own maps,
but will write no code.</dd>

<dt>
<b>developer</b></dt>

<dd>
User will write modules they needs as well as all of the above.</dd>

<h3>
Steps:</h3></center>

<ol>
<li>
Start with .cc file.&nbsp; Make sure it conforms to the <a href="http://www.csafe.utah.edu/development_environment/coding_standards/index.html">coding
standard</a>.</li>

<li>
Update/enhance <a href="http://www.csafe.utah.edu/development_environment/cocoon/index.html">cocoon
style comments</a>.</li>

<li>
Take a screen shot of the gui (if it has one) and convert to gif format.
This should be placed in ./doc relative to the .cc file for the module.&nbsp;
Name it <i>module_name</i>Gui.gif. use xv for generating grabbing the image,
it will grab the whole dialog, and just the dialog.&nbsp; If you need more
than one window in the grab, and you are on an SGI use snapshot, then xv
to convert to gif format.</li>

<li>
Write spec.xml.&nbsp; It should live in the same dir as the .cc file. See
the <a href="anotSpec.html">annotated spec.xml </a>to understand what each
tag is for.</li>

<li>
The current plan is to gmake docs: generate Specification in the various
formats (xml, html, latex) This is not currently implemented, so <b><u><font color="#993300">do
not do this step</font></u></b>.</li>
