  <!-- describe how this directory fits into SCIRun - why does it 
       exist, how does SCIRun benefit from it, etc. -->
    <p>
      Dataflow/Network provides the basic functionality of the SCIRun
      dataflow paradigm.  The notions of Modules, Ports, Connections
      and Networks are defined here.  It also provides the
      implementation for the NetworkEditor, which is the tool used by
      a network designer to build Networks.

    <why>
    <!-- Discuss why a developer would need or want to use the
         functions and/or classes in this directory. -->
      <p>
        One of the useful features of SCIRun is that it can easily
	be extended by developing new modules (algorithms) and new 
	ports (datatypes) for it.  To do this, a developer would
	write code that inherits functionality from the classes
	in this directory.  By inheriting from these classes, a
	developer can focus on the code needed to quickly implement
	a new algorithm.
      </p>
    </why>
    <when>
    <!-- Discuss when or where to use the functions and classes in
         this directory: From within modules?, when a certain event
	 occurs? -->
      <p>
        Most of the code in this directory is meant to be used
	internally by the SCIRun PSE only.  There are three instances
	in which a developer would use code in this directory
	external to the PSE: When writing modules, When writing ports,
	and when a developer would like to post a message to the 
	NetworkEditor's message window.
