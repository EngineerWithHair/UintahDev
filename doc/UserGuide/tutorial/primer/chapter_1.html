		<p><b>Chapter Overview</b><br>
		
		<p>In this first chapter, we will construct a SCIRun
		network [link] to perform a visualization task:
		rendering of a tetrahedral mesh.  Our &quot;net&quot;,
		will consist of three modules: data reader, geometry
		converter, and renderer.  We will read in the datafile
		from disk, set some rendering properties for the
		nodes, edges, and faces (<i>e.g.</i> the nodes will be
		rendered as blue spheres), and will render the
		geometry to the screen in an interactive viewing
		window.  We will begin constructing a net from scratch
		as shown, completed, in <b>Figure 1.1.</b>  In future chapters
		we will expand on this network, adding more features
		and more functionality with each successive iteration.

		<p><b>FieldReader User Interface</b><br>

		<p>You should set several environment variables in
		your shell before we begin running SCIRun.  First, the
		SCIRUN_DATA variable should point to the location of
		the SCIRunData directory on your system.  Second,
		since many of our example networks can be run with a
		variety of inputs, the SCIRUN_DATASET variable
		indicates which dataset to load.

		<p>For example, the network that we construct in this
		chapter loads a geometric mesh from disk and
		renders it to the screen.  Such a network will work on
		a wide variety of inputs, and so the SCIRUN_DATASET
		variable indicates which one the user
		would like to see.  In your Unix shell window, set
		your SCIRUN_DATA variable to point where you have
		installed the SCIRun data, and set your SCIRUN_DATASET
		variable to utahtorso-lowres (as shown in <b>Figure 1.2.</b>)
</div>

<p><img height="240" width="450" src="images/figures/1_2.gif"><br>
<b>Figure 1.2</b></p>
</center>
<div align="left">
<p><br>

<p>Having set your SCIRUN environment variables, you
are ready to run SCIRun.  Change into your SCIRun/src/
directory, and enter the command &quot;./scirun&quot;.
The SCIRun NetworkEditor window will appear on your
screen, as shown in <b>Figure 1.3.</b>
</div>
<center>
<p><img height="461" width="450" src="images/figures/1_3a.gif"><br>
<b>Figure 1.3</b></p>
</center>
<div align="left">
<p><br>

<p>The first module we include in our network
will be a FieldReader.  To create a FieldReader
module, pulldown the SCIRun menu and select
DataIO/FieldReader, as shown in <b>Figure 1.3.1.</b><p>
</div>
<center>
<p><img height="258" width="450" src="images/figures/1_3.gif"><br>
<b>Figure 1.3.1</b></p>
</center>
<div align="left">
<p><br>

<p> The module then appears on the network map
as a rectangular box, as seen in <b>Figure 1.4.</b><p>
</div>

<p><img height="512" width="500" src="images/figures/1_4.gif"><br>
<b>Figure 1.4</b></p>
</center>
<div align="left">
<p><br>

<p>The box has a user interface button that, when pressed, launches a file
browser window.  You can type, or point-and-click navigate to the
utahtorso-lowres/utahtorso-lowres-voltage.tvd.fld input file.  This dataset
is a low resolution tetrahedral mesh of a human torso.  When you select the
filename in the file-browser window, and press &quot;OK&quot;, the
file-browser window will disappear, and the FieldReader module will begin
to execute.  When the module finishes computing, the progress bar (the
rectangle in the lower righthand region of the module) turns green and the
module icon displays a number indicating the amount of CPU time required to
complete (<b>Figure 1.5</b>).

<p> The dataset that we just read-in is called a SCIRun &quot;Field&quot;.
The definition of a Field is a grouping of information that contains a
geometric mesh and a collection of data values associated with that mesh.
In this case, we have a tetrahedral mesh with voltages defined at the
nodes.  We provide a brief overview of Fields below, describing the various
types of geometric meshes, datavalues, and mappings aming them that SCIRun
supports.

<p><b>Overview of field types</b><br>

<p>SCIRun has eight different geometric meshes
available for Fields:
<UL>
  <LI> PointCloud: unconnected points.
  <LI> ScanlineField: a regularly segmented straight
      line.  (A regular 1D grid).
  <LI> ContourField: a segmented curve.
  <LI> ImageField: a regular 2D grid.
  <LI> TriSurf: a surface made of connected triangles.
  <LI> QuadSurf: a surface make of connected quadrillaterals.
  <LI> LatticeVol: a regular 3D grid.
  <LI> TetVol: a subdivision of space into tetrahedral elements.
  <LI> HexVol: a subdivision of space into hexagonal elements.
</UL>
<br>
<br>

<p>There are, at most, four different places in which
data can be stored in a field; at nodes, edges, faces,
and cells.  The dimensionality of the mesh type limits
the available locations.  For instance, a TriSurf has
no three dimensional cell elements, thus, data cannot
be stored at cells in that field type.

<p>The following data types can be stored in a field:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tensor
  <li>Vector
  <li>double
  <li>float
  <li>int
  <li>short
  <li>char
  <li>unsigned int
  <li>unsigned short
  <li>unsigned char<br>
</ul>
<p><br>

<p><b>Showfield module</b><br>

<p>We will now add a second module to our network.
Select ShowField from the SCIRun/Visualization menu.
This module is used for visualizing our various field
types.  The module's User Interface (UI) has options for
rendering various geometry from the field, as well as
some special options for rendering vector data.  ShowField
can use color to represent data within the geometry if
so desired.  For now we will want to just render the
nodes of the geometry as blue spheres.

<p>Select the UI button on the ShowField module (<b>Figure 1.6</b>).
</div>
<center>
<p><img height="512" width="500" src="images/figures/1_6.gif"><br>
<b>Figure 1.6</b></p>
</center>
<div align="left">
<p><br>  The Nodes
tab is selected by default in addition to the
Sphere
Display Type.  However, the default color 
is grey.  To change the default color, select the
Default Color button near the bottom of the dialogue.
This will pop up a new dialogue with red, green, and
blue sliders.  Set red and green to 0.0, and blue to
1.00.  Then select the &quot;OK&quot; button in this
color dialogue.  To remove the Dialogue from view,
select &quot;Cancel&quot;.

<p> Change the Node Scale to 2 and set the Sphere Resolution to 5. Turn off the display of edges and faces.  Select
the Edges tab in the ShowField dialogue.  Turn off
Show Edges.  Select the Faces tab.  Turn off Show
Faces.  Now the ShowField module is ready to render
the nodes from our input geometry as blue spheres.

<p><b>Hooking modules together</b><br>

<p>Now that you have two modules in your canvas, they
need to be connected so that data can flow between
them.  Output ports in SCIRun are always on the bottom
of the module, whereas input ports are always on top.
Ports that have the same color may be connected.  Each
datatype in SCIRun that can be passed through ports
has a unique color.

<p>Using your middle mouse select the yellow output port
on the FieldReader (<b>Figure 1.7.1</b>).  You should see the name of the
port pop up, as well as lines drawn indicating
possible connections.  If you then drag your middle
mouse towards the ShowField input Field port (the
yellow one) eventually you will see the line turn red (<b>Figure 1.7.2</b>).
Once it is red you may release the middle mouse
button.  What you should see is a yellow datapipe
connection between FieldReader and ShowField (<b>Figure 1.7.3</b>).

<p><br>

<p>Press the "Execute" button on the ShowField UI to force the
module to execute its algorithm. ShowField is expected to
work on any of our Field types. We have numerous field
types, each that can contain any data type. For example
ShowField should visualize TetVol's with double data, or
TetVol's with Vector or Tensor data. This is true of
TriSurf's and all of our Field types. You may see how
this creates a combinatorial explosion of accepted types.
As you might quess we have used the C++ Template mechanism
to achieve this versatility, but it comes at the price of
having to compile all of the types we might ever use into
our code base.

<p>Our approach is to only compile algorithms that use an
exact field type. This information is not known until a
module gets its input data, so we wait and compile that
algorithm then. We use <a href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/publications/mcole01/dyn.pdf">Dynamic Compilation</a>
to accomplish this.  So when ShowField executes for the
first time, you will notice a delay while it compiles the
algorithm specific to the field type and loads it into
SCIRun.  We cache away this compiled algorithm in a shared
library so that it can be loaded the next time you run
without delay.

<p>ShowField will then execute the newly loaded algorithm
passing its results along downstream.

<p><b>Viewer module</b><br>

<p>The last module we will add to this network will be
the Viewer module.  This module is located under the
SCIRun/Render menu.  Once the module has been
instantiated, connect the output port from ShowField
into the Viewer input port.  You probably noticed that
the Viewer module generated a new input port.  Some
modules in SCIRun have dynamic input ports, Viewer is
an example of this.  This allows the Viewer to always
accept additional data to Render.

<p>To see the graphical rendering of the data that has
been passed into the Viewer module, press the Viewer
UI button (<b>Figure 1.10</b>).<p>

<p>(Text from Rob on navigating in the
ViewWindow here...  also, add text describing turning
on and off faces from ShowField.)

<p><b>Saving and reloading networks</b><br>

<p>The three module network we created above will
serve as a foundation for the nets we will create
through the rest of this tutorial.  As such, we will
take a few moments to examine how nets can be saved to
disk and then can be reloaded in a future SCIRun
session.

<p>To save a SCIRun network (<b>Figure 1.11</b>), pull down the File menu
bar from the top of the SCIRun window, and select
&quot;Save&quot;.  A file browser will pop up, and you
will be prompted to choose a location and filename for
your net.  By convention, we keep most nets in the
SCIRun/src/nets/ directory, but you can store them in
whatever location is most convenient for you.  For
this example, let's store the net as
SCIRun/src/nets/show-torso-mesh.net (we use the .net
suffix for SCIRun network files).<p>

</div>
<center>
<p><img height="283" width="444" src="images/figures/1_11.gif"><br>
<b>Figure 1.11</b></p>
</center>
<div align="left">
<p><br>

<p>Now, quit out of SCIRun and restart it.  To load in
the saved net (<b>Figure 1.12</b>), pulldown the &quot;Load...&quot; option
from the File menu bar, and select
SCIRun/src/nets/show-torso-mesh.net The net should
reload into SCIRun, just as it was when you saved it.
If we change something (e.g.,  rotate your view in the
ViewWindow or change the rendering color of the nodes
in ShowField), then we have two options if we want to
re-save our net.  First, we can overwrite the existing
show-torso-mesh.net file by simply pulling down File
-&gt; Save.  Alternatively, we can save it to a new
file using File -&gt; Save As...  For more information
on the File menu options (such as Insert and Clear),
please see Section XXX of the User's Manual.
