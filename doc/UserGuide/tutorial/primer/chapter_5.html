                <p><b>Chapter Overview</b><br>

		<p>In Chapters 1-4, we learned about deataflow
                programming, and constructed visualization networks
                for exploring datasets.  But where did the Field
                voltage datavalues come from?  In this chapter, we will
                construct a simulation network that computes simulated
                voltages for a realistic volume conductor problem.

		<p>In preceeding chapters, we used modules from
                the central SCIRun package.  Those modules have been
                general purpose tools--not targeted towards
                any specific application.  By contrast, in this
                chapter we begin using modules from the BioPSE
                package, a set of tools specifically
                written for the modeling, simulation, and
                visualization of bioelectric field problems.

		<p>Typically, Packages (<b>Figure 5.1</b>) are logically
	        grouped sets of modules and the supporting code for those
	        modules. They can be created by anyone, and compiled into
	        SCIRun. Packages can be wholly dependent upon SCIRun code,
	        or can depend upon any additional third party code.
	        Packages can, in fact, simply wrap around third party code,
	        such that SCIRun can use Dataflow functionality. Packages
	        are a major mechanism to bridging in SCIRun. Bridging is
	        the concept that SCIRun can be used in conjunction with other useful software such as Matlab or Teem.

                <p><b>Volume conductor problem</b><br>

		<p>Given a volume conductor model and an equivalent
		dipole source, we would like to compute the potentials
		and electric field induced by the source through the
		domain. An analytic solution exists for problems of some
		very specific geometric models (e.g., analytic cylinders or
		spheres). However, for most real-world problems, we can
		only obtain the solution through discretization.  For
		this application, we will discretize our domain into
		tetrahedral finite elements, where each element contains a
		conductivity tensor defining how electricity travels
		through its region of the domain.  Within each element, we 
		assume a piece-wise linear potential field (piece-wise
		constant electric field).

		<p>The above problem is governed mathematically by
		Poisson's equation:<br>

		<img src="images/equation.gif" align="absbottom"></p>

		<p>where <img height="16" width="11" src="images/sigma.gif">
		is the local conductivity tensor, <img height="16"
		width="13" src="images/phi.gif"> is the voltage over the
		domain, and <img height="19" width="36" src="images/i.gif"
		align="texttop"> is a source term indicating where
		there are current sources within our domain. In
		plain language, this means: the divergence (<img height="16"
		width="25" src="images/del_dot.gif" align="absbottom">) of
		the electric field (<img height="16" width="15"
		src="images/del.gif" align="absbottom"><img height="16"
		width="13" src="images/phi.gif" align="absbottom">) is zero
		everywhere there is not a current source. Discretizing
		this onto our tetrahedral domain, we approximate the
		divergence of the electric field with the stiffness
		matrix <font size="4"><b>A</b></font>. <img
		height="16" width="13" src="images/phi.gif"> is a vector
		composed of voltages at the nodes. And <font
		size="4"><b>b</b></font> is a source vector indicating
		the flux through the nodes -- it is only non-zero for
		nodes that are corners of elements containing a
		current source. Given a stiffness matrix, <font
		size="4"><b>A</b></font>, and a source vector, <font
		size="4"><b>b</b></font>, we can solve the linear
		system:<br>

		height="16" width="13" src="images/phi.gif"><img height="16"
		width="20" src="images/equals.gif"><img height="16"
		width="10" src="images/b.gif"><br>

		<p>to determine the potentials,<img height="16"
		width="13" src="images/phi.gif">, through the field. Taking
		the gradient, <img height="16" width="15"
		src="images/del.gif"><img height="16" width="13"
		src="images/phi.gif">, we get the electric field through the
		domain.<br>

                <p><b>Finite element simulation network</b><br>

		<p>To compute the electric and potential fields given
		a finite element volume conductor mesh and a dipolar
		current source, we follow these steps:<br>

		<p>1 -- Read in the finite element mesh (tet elements,
		with a conductivity tensors for each cell).

		<p>2 -- Read in any dipole sources.

		<p>3 -- Construct the finite element stiffness matrix
		based on the conductivity mesh.

		<p>4 -- Construct the right hand side source vector
		based on the location and orientation of any dipole
		sources.

		<p>5 -- Solve the linear system <img height="15"
		width="14" src="images/A.gif"><img height="16"
		width="13" src="images/phi.gif"><img height="16"
		width="20" src="images/equals.gif"><img height="16"
		width="10" src="images/b.gif">, to determine the
		potentials at the nodes.

		<p>Each of the above steps corresponds to a SCIRun
		module.  For steps 1 and 2, we will use
		SCIRun/DataIO/FieldReader modules.  For step 3 we will
		use a BioPSE/Forward/SetupFEMatrix module.  For step 4
		we will use a BioPSE/Forward/ApplyFEMCurrentSource
		module.  And for step 5, we will use a
		SCIRun/Math/SolveMatrix module.  All of these modules
		should be connected as shown in Figure XXX.  The User
		Interface settings for each of the modules are
		described in the next paragraphs.

                <p><b>FEM user interface settings</b><br>

		<p>The SetupFEMatrix module constructs a finite
		element stiffness matrix from a tetrahedral volume
		mesh.  On the UI (<b>Figure 5.3</b>)we can choose whether to incorporate
		the local conductivity tensors into the stiffness
		matrix, or whether to use a uniform conductivity.  For
		this application, we will incorporate the local
		conductivity changes.

										<b>Figure 5.3</b></p>
									</center>
									<div align="left">
										<p><br>


		<p>The ApplyFEMCurrentSource module modifies the
		right hand side vector to account for current
		sources within the model.  On the UI (<b>Figure 5.4</b>), you can choose
		whether the current sources are due to a dipole or to
		a source/sink electrode pair.  Select the "dipole"
		setting.

										<p><br>


		<p>The SolveMatrix module solves a linear system using
		one of several linear algebra methods.  Choose the
		"Conjugate Gradient" solver on the UI (<b>Figure 5.5</b>), and set the
		Target Error to 0.0001, and the Maximum Iterations to
		200.  Note: the SolveMatrix UI must remain either open
		or minimized while the solver is running; it must not
		be closed completely.  For more information on the
		SolveMatrix module, click on this link.

		<p>Lastly, for this simulation you should choose the
                utahtorso-lowres-mesh.tvt.fld Field for the
                FieldReader on the left, and the
                utahtorso-lowres-dipole.pcv.fld Field for the
                FieldReader on the right.  The mesh Field contains the
                tetrahedral finite element mesh of the Utah Torso
                model, with conductivity indices stored at each
                element of the model.  The dipole Field contains a
                single dipole vector, positioned within the torso
                volume.

                <p><b>Running the simulation</b><br>
		
		<p>With all of the modules connected and all of the UI
		state configured, you are ready to run the simulation.
		Select the "Execute" item from one of the module icon
		dropdown menus, or press the "Execute" button on a
		module's user interface.  As the simulation
		progresses, you will see the residual plot in the
		SolveMatrix module converge which is located at the bottom of the SolveMatrix UI.  Congratulations, you
		have solved a finite element problem!<br>
