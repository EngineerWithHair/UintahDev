                <p><b>Chapter Overview</b><br>

		<p>In Chapter 6 we combined simulation and
                visualization components to form a single, large
                dataflow network.  While the visualization components
                were dynamic (e.g. you could change the isovalue or
                streamline seed positions), the models were static.
                In this chapter we will add a feedback module that
                will allow you to change the position of the
                dipole model, and interactively visualize the results.

                <p><b>ShowDipoles</b><br>

		<p>The module we will insert into the net from the
		previous chapter (Figure XXX) is under the
		BioPSE/Visualization menu, and is called ShowDipoles.
		This module takes in a PointCloud of Vectors (the
		SCIRun representation for a group of dipoles), and
		allows the user to visualize and interact with those
		dipoles.  This module has two outputs: a Field and a
		Geometry object.  The Geometry object attaches to the
		Viewer module, providing a graphical depiction of the
		dipoles as arrow widgets.  The user can select the
		dipoles by pressing the Shift button and clicking on a
		dipole with the left mouse button.  Once selected the
		dipoles can be moved or rotated, depending on which
		part of the widget is selected.  The latest version of
		the dipole positions and orientations is sent through
		the Field output port and into the
		ApplyFEMCurrentSource module.

		<p>The ShowDipoles UI (<b>Figure 7.1</b>) has several configuration
		options for controlling how the dipoles are
		graphically displayed.  Select the "Normalize Largest"
		radiobutton, set the Widget Size to 1, select
		"Show Last As Vector", and unselect "Show Lines".
		These options will result in a set of dipoles whose
		lengths have been uniformly scaled such that the
		longest vector now has length 1.

		<p>The result of connecting this last module is a
		complete forward finite element network.  This is the
		same net that we have provided in your source tree as:
		Packages/BioPSE/nets/forward-fem.net

		<p>Please feel free to experiment with your completed
		network.  You can explore how different dipole source
		positions and directions effect the voltage and
		electric field distributions through the volume.  You
		can compare different linear solution methods with the
		SolveMatrix module, or compare isosurface extraction
		times using MC (Marching Cubes) versus the NOISE
		(Near-Optimal IsoSurface Extraction) algorithm.
		SCIRun is a flexible environment designed for
		interactive exploration of what-if scenarios.  Have
		fun exploring!<br>
