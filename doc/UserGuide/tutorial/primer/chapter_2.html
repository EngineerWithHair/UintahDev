                <p>&lt;subhead:Chapter overview&gt;<br>

                <p>In Chapter 1, we constructed a small network to
                visualize the geometry of a mesh.  In this chapter, we
                will extend that net, adding tools to look at data
                values on the geometry.  Specifically, we will
                visualize a scalar quantity (voltage) on a set of
                points in space (a PointCloud of electrodes).
                  
                <p>From our previous net, we hooked three modules 
		together--FieldReader, ShowField, and Viewer--as shown in
                Figure xxx.  On the user interface of
                the ShowField module, we used the Default Color
                selector to make all of the geometry render blue.  In
                this chapter, rather than mapping a single color to
                all of the geometry, we vary the colors over the
                geometry based on the scalar values in the Field.  For
                a more complete description of how Fields map data
                values to geometry, click here [link].
                  
                <p>&lt;subhead:Colormaps&gt;<br>

                <p>The datavalues are mapped to the geometric
                mesh, and we also need to map from datavalue to
                color.  The ColorMap class in SCIRun provides this
                mapping.  The ColorMap also contains a set of evenly spaced colors
                (RGBA),a minimum and maximum datavalue range to
                which each color range corresponds.  Several example
                colormaps are shown in Figure xxx.
                  
                <p>The GenStandardColorMaps module generates colormaps in
		SCIRun. This module contains a selection of default colormaps.  For each
                of the colormaps, the user can control the opacity
                (also known as alpha) for each datavalue, and can
                choose the number of discrete entries in the colormap
                table.
                  
                <p>The minimum/maximum range of the ColorMap determines
                what values in the data are assigned what colors.  By
                default the minimum/maximum range is from 0 to 1.  Using the
                RescaleColorMap module, the user can set the min/max
                values by hand, or can &quot;auto-scale&quot; them to
                correspond with the min/max datavalue range from a
                scalar Field.
                  
                <p>Now we can add a GenStandardColorMaps and a
                RescaleColorMap module to our net from Chapter 1.
                Both of these modules are located under the
                SCIRun/Visualization menu.  Connect the output from
                GenStandardColorMaps to the input of RescaleColorMap,
                connect the output from the FieldReader to the other
                input port of RescaleColorMap.  Finally, connect the
                output from RescaleColorMap to the input of ShowField.
                Your network should now look like Figure xxx.  Note that 
		when the connection was created
                between FieldReader and ResaleColorMap, the
                ResaleColorMap module added another input Field port.
                This last &quot;dynamic&quot; port is just like the
                one in the Viewer module.  In this case, if the user
                connects more than one Field into RescaleColorMap, the
                min/max range for auto-scaling will correspond to the
                min/max range of datavalues from all of the input
                Fields.
                  
                <p>All that remains for this net to be complete is to read
                in a Field.  Use the FieldReader User Interface (UI)
                to read in utahtorso-lowres-electrodes.pcd.fld--a
                point cloud of electrode positions, with voltages
                measured from a single instant in time.  After reading in
                the data, you should see an image like
                Figure xxx in the ViewWindow.
                  
                <p>&lt;subhead:Module user interfaces&gt;<br>

                <p>Now we'll explore the User Interfaces for these two
                modules.  Opening the UI for GenStandardColorMaps, you
                will see a window like Figure xxx.  On the left, we
                have a collection of standard maps we can choose from.
                At the top, we see the selected ColorMaps, and have a
                clickable interface for changing the opacity of each
                color swatch in the map.  Under the rendered ColorMap,
                we have two more interface features: a gamma value for
                non-linear compression or expandsion of the
                otherwise-linear color ramp, and a Resolution slider
                for setting the number of distinct colors that will be
                stored in the color table.  By choosing a low
                resolution, we can generate &quot;banded&quot;
                visualizations; by choosing a higher resolution, we
                can generate smoother color transitions.
                  
                <p>Figure XXX shows the UI to the ResaleColorMap module. 
		The user can choose whether to set the min/max
                range of the ColorMap manually or
                automatically.  As mentioned above, if the range is
                auto-scaled, it will correspond to the minimum and
                maximum datavalues from all of the input Fields that
                connect to the module.
                  
                <p>By changing the ColorMap, in GenStandardColorMaps,
                from Rainbow to Dark Body, we change the image in the
                ViewWindow from Figure xxx to Figure xxx.  Changing
                the ColorMap range to a manual setting of -0.1 to 0.5,
                we are able to &quot;clamp&quot; the range of colors,
                as soon in Figure xxx.

                <p>The second input port on the ShowField module
                accepts a ColorMap.  If this port is connected when
                ShowField executes, it maps the data values in its
                input Field to a color in the input ColorMap, and
                renders accordingly.  If a ColorMap is present in
                ShowField the, the module ignores the default color, and uses
                ColorMap value.
