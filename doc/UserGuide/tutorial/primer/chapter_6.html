                <p><b>Chapter Overview</b><br>

		<p>In the previous chapter we implemented a
		network to solve a bioelectric finite element
		problem.  The output of that network was a solution
		vector, <img height="16" width="13"
		src="images/phi.gif">, containing the potential at
		each of the nodes in the finite element mesh.

		<p>In Chapters 1-4 we constructed a set of
		visualization networks to explore scalar and vector
		Fields.

		<p>In this chapter we will put these two pieces
		together.  We will reuse the finite element simulation
		network from Chapter 5, as well as the visualization
		network from Chapter 4.  The only missing piece is a
		module that can connect the solution vector of scalar
		values to the nodes of the tetrahedral finite element
		mesh.  The module that does this is called
		ManageFieldData and is described below.

                <p><b>ManageFieldData</b><br>

                <p>This module performs two simultanious operations.
                First the &quot;Input Field&quot; is split into it's
                mesh part and it's data values.  The data values are
                packaged up and passed to the &quot;Output
                Matrix&quot; port.  Second the input field geometry is
                joined with the data from the Input Matrix, and the
                result is passed out on the &quot;Output Field&quot;
                port.  If the input matrix is not present, then the
                second operation is not performed and the Output Field
                is the same as the Input Field.  The format of the
                &quot;Output Matrix&quot; will be a column matrix if
                the nput field was of scalar type.  It will be an Nx3
                matrix if the input field contained vectors.  If the
                field contained tensors it will be Nx9 matrix, where
                the tensor is flattened out in left to right, top to
                bottom order.  The &quot;Input Matrix&quot; should
                have the same number of values as the field where the
                values are to be stored.  The type of the Input Field
                is preserved in the Output field as well.  For
                instance, if the input field is a vector field, the
                Output Field will also be a vector field, and the
                input matrix should be an Nx3 matrix where N is equal
                to the number of elements to be filled in.

                <p><b>Combining simulation and visualization</b><br>

		<p>Combining the finite element simulation net from
		Chapter 5 (Figure XXX) with the visualization net from
		Chapter 4 (Figure XXX), and adding a ManageFieldData
		module between them, you should have a net that looks
		like Figure XXX.  Executing the network, you should
		have an image in your ViewWindow that looks like
		Figure XXX.<br>
