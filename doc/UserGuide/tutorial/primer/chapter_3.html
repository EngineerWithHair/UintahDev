        <p><b>Chapter Overview</b><br>

        <p>In Chapters 1 and 2, we constructed SCIRun networks to
        visualize the geometry and data values in a Field.  In this
        Chapter we will explore some more visualization techniques,
        and will look at &quot;filter&quot; modules that input a Field
        and produce a new derived Field as output.  Rather than
        building one net to introduce all of these new modules, we
        will construct several nets, each describing a single
        technique.  To keep things simple, we will divide this chapter
        into three sections, one for each method.
                
        <p><b>Section:3A - FieldBoundary</b><br>

	<p>The first visualization we will implement will be a
        boundary extraction.  This module takes any type of Field as
        input, and produces a new Field that only contains the
        boundary as output.  For example, given a tetrahedral volume
        Field, the module produces a triangulated surface Field of
        just the boundary faces as output.

	<p>Create a FieldBounday module from
	SCIRun/Fields/FieldBoundary.  Attach the output from a
	FieldReader (choose the utahtorso-lowres-voltage.tvd.fld file again)
	to the FieldBoundary input port, and pass the contents of the
	first output port of the FieldBoundary module into the first
	input port of a ShowField module.  Set the ShowField module to
	display just edges (turn off the nodes and the faces).  Render
	the edges as cylinder, with a scale of 1.0.

	<p>Connect the output from the ShowField module into a Viewer.
	The net you have created should look like the one shown in
	<b>Figure 3.1</b>; the view in the ViewWindow should look like <b>Figure 3.2</b>.

	<b>Figure 3.2</b></p>
	</center>
	<div align="left">
	<p><br>


        <p><b>Section:3B - DirectInterpolate</b><br>

	<p>Interpolating data values from one Field to another Field
	is another useful technique for visualizing data.  In this
	section we will read in two datasets, the first will contain
	the utahtorso volume mesh we looked at in Chapter 1, and the
	second will contain the electrodes that we looked at in
	Chapter 2.  The volume Field contains simulated voltage values
	through the entire volume.  For each position of the electrode
	positions, we will look up the corresponding voltage value
	from the volume mesh, and we will then output a new combined
	Field containing the geometry of the electrodes and their
	corresponding interpoltated voltages from the volume.  The
	module that implements this algorithm is called
	DirectInterpolate (SCIRun/Fields/DirectInterpolate).

	<p>To implement the net described above, we will need two
	FieldReader modules, a DirectInterpolate module, a ShowField
	module, a GenStandardColorMaps module, a RescaleColorMap
	module, and a Viewer module.  Those should be hooked together
	as shown in <b>Figure 3.3</b>.

      </div>

	<b>Figure 3.3</b></p>
	</center>
	<div align="left">
	<p><br>


	<p>The FieldReader on the left should read in the
	utahtorso-lowres-voltage.tvd.fld input file, and the
	FieldReader on the right should read in the
	utahtorso-lowres-electrodes.pcd.fld input file.  The resulting
	image in the ViewWindow should look like <b>Figure 3.4</b>.

        <p><b>Section:3C - StreamLines</b><br>

        <p>The last visualization tecnique we will explore in this
        Chapter is streamline advection.  The StreamLine module takes
        in a vector Field, and a Field of sample points, and outputs a
        new Field consisting of a sequence of path-integral curves
        generated from advecting (integrating) the sample positions
        through the (derivative) vector Field.

	<p>We will generate the input vector Field by using the
	Gradient module (SCIRun/Fields/Gradient) to compute the
	gradient of the utahtorso-lowres-voltage.tvd.fld (this
	produces the negative electric field).  Connect the output
	from the Gradient module to the the first Field input port of
	the StreamLines module.

	<p>To generate a sample distribution of streamline seed
	points, we will use the SampleField module.  SampleField
	generates samples from any type of input field and outputs the
	samples as a PointCloud field.  The samples can be generated
	randomly or can be user selected via a 3D widget.  For
	streamline visualization, we will use a 3D "rake" widget to
	place our distribution of seed points.

	<p>To interactively position the rake of seed points within
	the volume, connect the Geometry output port (pink) from this
	module to the Viewer module.  Then select the "rake" option
	from the SampleField UI and set the number of samples to 15.
	Finally, connect the Field output port from this module to the
	second Field input port of the StreamLines module.

	<p>At this point, we have streamlines coming out of the
        StreamLines module, and we would like to render them.  Before
        we do, though, we can attach scalar datavalues to the
        streamline nodes.  To accomplish this, we use the
        DirectInterpolate module described above.  We will again use
        the voltage datavalues from the
        utahtorso-lowres-voltage.tvd.fld Field.  Attaching all of the
        modules, we have the network shown in <b>Figure 3.5</b>.

	<b>Figure 3.5</b></p>
	</center>
	<div align="left">
	<p><br>


	<p>The Streamlines module works by integrating the seed points
	through the vector Field.  We are using a fifth order
	integration mthod: Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm.  To run
	this algorithm, we must set three parameters: Error Tolerance,
	Step Size, and a Maximum Number of Steps.  These three
	parameters should be set to 0.01, 0.1, and 200, respectively,
	in the StreamLines UI (as shown in <b>Figure 3.6</b>).

        <p><b>Network execution and data dependence</b><br>

	<p>There are several ways to initiate execution of a SCIRun
	network that has not yet "fired".  The first is to click the
	right mouse button on the name of one of the module icons, and
	to select the "Execute" option from the dropdown menu
	(<b>Figure 3.7</b>).  The second is to press any of the
	"Execute" buttons that appear on many of the module User
	Interface.  Either of these actions will initiate the
	execution of the selected module, as well as the execution of
	any modules that are part of the data dependency graph of that
	selected module.

	</center>
	<div align="left">
	<p><br>

	<p>After executing the network, you should see an image like
	<b>Figure 3.8</b> in the ViewWindow.  The rake widget appears
	as a gray stick in the scene.  You can move this widget around
	to new positions by pressing down the shift key and then
	clicking on the widget with the left mouse button.  When you
	release the mouse button, the streamlines will automatically
	be recomputed from the new seed positions.
