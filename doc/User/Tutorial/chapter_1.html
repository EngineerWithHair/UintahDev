    <p><b>Chapter Overview</b><br>
    
    <p>In this first chapter, we will construct a SCIRun network (see the 
    <a HREF="../Guide/usersguide/srug3.html#sec:startingup">User's Guide 3.0,
    Starting SCIRun</a>) that performs a visualization task: 
    rendering a
    tetrahedral mesh.  Our &quot;net,&quot will consist of three
    types of modules: data reader, geometry converter, and renderer.  These modules are FieldReader, ShowField, and Viewer.<br> 
    
 
    <p>We will read the Field data from a file, set some rendering
    properties for the nodes, edges, and faces (the
    nodes will be rendered as blue spheres), and render the
    geometry to the screen in an interactive Viewer window.<br>  
    
    <p>To begin, we will construct a net (as shown,
    completed, in <b>Figure 1.1</b>), and in the chapters that follow, we will
    expand on this network, adding more features and
    functionality as we progress.<br>

    <p><b><H4><A name="section-1">FieldReader User Interface</A></b></H4>
    
    <p>You should set two environment variables in your shell
     before starting SCIRun. For more information about environment
     variables, you may consult the <a
     HREF="../Guide/usersguide/srug3.html#sec:scirundata">User's Guide 3.4,
     SCIRun_DATA</a>.  This process assumes that you have downloaded the SCIRunData directory, a separate download from the SCIRun build.  
    <ol>
      <li value="1.">The SCIRUN_DATA variable points to the location 
      of the SCIRunData directory on your system.  
      <li value="2.0">The SCIRUN_DATASET variable indicates which dataset
      to load 
      since many of our example networks run with a variety of data inputs such as sphere, brain-EG, and utahtorso-lowres.
    </ol> 

<p>To begin, we will construct a network that loads a geometric mesh from disk and renders it to the screen.  In your Unix shell window:</p>
<ol>
  <li value="1.">Set your SCIRUN_DATA variable, pointing to the
  location of SCIRunData.  
  <li value="2.">Set your SCIRUN_DATASET variable to utahtorso-lowres
  (as shown in <b>Figure 1.2.</b>)</ol>

  <p>Having set these environment variables, you are now ready to
  start SCIRun.   
  <ol>
    <li value="1.">Change into your SCIRun/src/ directory, and
    enter the command &quot;./scirun&quot;.  SCIRun cannot be run as a background application.  
    <li value="2.">The SCIRun NetworkEditor window appears on your
    screen, as shown in 
    <b>Figure 1.3.</b>.</ol>
	<p> The NetworkEditor screen consists of three frames: the GlobalView frame in the left uppermost corner; the Error frame in the right uppermost corner, and the NetEdit frame. The NetEdit frame is a large area in which you will construct your networks of modules. Since the NetEdit frame is so extensive, the Global View frame shows you which part of the NetEdit frame you are currently viewing. The Error frame will show errors that appear in red during startup, or during the execution of a net.

    <p><br>
   <p> A module is a single-purpose unit that functions within a dataflow environment. Modules will always have at least one input port for receiving data, located at the top of the module, or one output port for sending data, located at the bottom.</p> 
<p>For a more complete description of modules, you may consult the User's Guide, Section 2.3 Modules and Networks>.</p>
<p> Each datatype in SCIRun has a unique color such as yellow, purple, or pink.  You may connect ports of the same color. These colors are described in more detail in the User's Guide, Section 4.2, Anatomy of a Module.</p> 
<p>By joining the modules together, data passes from one module to another; two or more connected modules form a SCIRun network (&quot;net&quot;).</p>
<br> 
    <p>We will first create a FieldReader module that loads a SCIRun Field.</p>
	<p><ul><li>From the
    SCIRun menu, select DataIO/FieldReader, as shown in
    <b>Figure 1.3.1.</b></p></ul>

    <p>A Field contains a geometric mesh and
    a collection of data values mapped onto that mesh. Data can be stored at the nodes, edges, faces, and cells of the mesh. In this case,
    we use a tetrahedral mesh with voltages defined at the nodes of the
    mesh.</p> 
<p>The dimensionality of the mesh type limits
    the available storage locations. For example, TriSurf has nodes,
    edges, and planar faces, but not cells, which we assume to be
    three-dimensional elements.  As a result, a TriSurf cannot store any
    data in cells--but it can store data in edges or faces.</p>
<p>The brief overview below describes the various types
    of geometric meshes, data values, and mappings that SCIRun
    supports.</p><br>
    
    <p><A name="section-2"><b>Overview of field types</A></b><br>
    
    <p>SCIRun has eight different geometric meshes
    available for Fields:

    <p><b>Setting the ShowField User Interface</b><br>

    
    <p>The ShowField module has options for changing the visual representations of a Field's geometry.  For example, in the dataset we have just loaded (using the FieldReader module), you will change the color of the nodes to blue spheres.</p>
 
        
    <p><ol>

      module.</p>

      <li ><p>In the color GUI, you can use the sliders to adjust the color values. Set Red and Green to 0.00, and Blue to 1.00. The Alpha value remains at 0.50 </p>  
      <li><p>Select the &quot;OK&quot; button in the color GUI. Notice that the Default Color swatch in the ShowField GUI has changed to blue.  Your SCIRun environment should look like <b>Figure 1.8</b>.</p>  
      <li ><p>In the color GUI, Select &quot;Cancel&quot; to close the window.</p></ol>

<p>We will now change the scale and resolution of the nodes.</p>
 
      <ol><li><p>In the ShowField GUI, you can increase the Node Scale interval by a power of 10 by pressing the + button.  Set the Node Scale to 2.</p>
<p><li>Set the Sphere Resolution
	  to 5.</p>

      <li><p>Go the the Faces tab and repeat the same action.</p></ol><br> 
      <p>The ShowField module is now ready to render the nodes as blue
	  spheres. The module will &quot;Interactively Update&quot;, by default, to execute after every change.  Or, you may select &quot;Execute Button Only&quot; that holds all changes until you press the Execute button.

    <p>Consult the <a HREF="../Guide/usersguide/srug4.html#sec:executenet">
    User's Guide 4.5,
    Executing a Network</a> for more details. 
    <p>ShowField works with any of the SCIRun Field data types. These data types must be first compiled into a shared library as needed where they are saved for future use.  This process is called &quot;Dynamic Compilation.&quot;</p>
<p>As a result, Dynamic Compilation causes a delay when the module executes for the first time. For more detail about this process, refer to the PDF document <a
    href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/publications/mcole01/dyn.pdf">Dynamic
    Compilation</a> or the Developer's Guide, Section .

    <!--chapter break here-->
    


    <p><b><A name="section-5">Viewer module</b><br></A>
    
    <p>The Viewer module is the last that we will add to our
    network. You may find more information about the Viewer in the <a
    HREF="../Guide/usersguide/srug5.html#sec:viewer">User's Guide 5.0,
    Visualization with the Viewer</a>. 
    <ol>
      <li>Locate the Viewer under the SCIRun/Render
	  menu.  
      <li>Connect the output port from ShowField into the Viewer
	  input port.   As a result, the Viewer module has generated a new
	  input port. The Viewer provides an example of SCIRun modules that
	  have dynamic input ports.
      <LI> To generate a Viewer window press the Viewer's UI button.
      <LI> In the Viewer window, you will see a set of orthogonal axes as
	  arrows.  Now look for the button near the bottom called
	  Autoview; press that and you should see the points of the
	  geometry, something like in <b>Figure 1.10</b>  
      <LI> Things may not look quite like they should, so continue with the next section
	  for directions on manipulating the Viewer.

       <p><b><A name="section-6">Navigating the Viewer Window</b><br></A>
    
    <p>Since the Viewer is one of the most important modules of SCIRun,
    you may want to know more about its functionality.  The <a
    HREF="../Guide/usersguide/srug5.html#sec:view-anatomy">User's Guide 5.1,
    Anatomy of the Viewer Window</a> provides a full description of the
    Viewer.   
    
    <p> <b>Figure 1.10</b> shows the Viewer window from the
    network you have built earlier in this chapter. In the lower right
    corner of the Viewer's window you will 
    find buttons for controlling the display. However, the controls you will 
    use most frequently are not visible.
    
    <p><b><A name="section-7">Mouse controls</b><br></A>
    
    <p>The mouse has functionality that works with the Viewer. The <a
    HREF="../Guide/usersguide/srug5.html#sec:view-mouse">User's Guide 5.2,
    Mouse Control in the Viewer</a> 
	provides more complete information.
    <p>To get a feel for this functionality:
    <ol>
      <li> Move the mouse to the center of the Viewer window.
      <li> Click and hold the left mouse button. 
      <li> While holding, slide the mouse and objects in the Viewer window
	  shift to follow the mouse movement.   
      <li> Now release the mouse and move it back to the center of the
	  object.
      <LI> Click and hold the middle mouse button and then drag it around;
	  objects in the Viewer will now rotate.
      <li> Release the button and move the mouse to the edge of
	  the objects in the Viewer window.  
      <li> Click, hold, and drag the middle mouse button. The object still
	  rotates but in a different direction from before.  Up and down
	  motions cause the objects to rotate counterclockwise and 
	  clockwise, rather than around a horizontal axis by clicking on
	  the middle of the objects.
    </ol>
    
    <p>To picture the rotation action of the mouse, imagine the objects
    sitting  
    within a sphere. To grab a point on the sphere, click the middle mouse
    button. 
    Moving the mouse drags that point on the sphere around as if the sphere
    were free to rotate but not to shift its position.  By this mechanism,
    the actual movement of the objects 
    depends on the point you click on before moving the mouse. To use an 
    analogy, this is 
    like placing a floating ball in a bowl full of water, touching the ball
    only
    at one point, and then rotating the ball by moving your finger.
	
    <p>Using this type of mouse control, objects can rotate in three
    dimensions  
    while the mouse moves only in two.  With experimentation, you will 
    be able to orient objects in whatever direction you
    wish through simple mouse manipulations.

    <p>Clicking and dragging the right mouse button 
    causes the contents of the Viewer window to get larger and
    smaller.  This creates the impression of moving closer in or
    further away from the contents of the window <b>(Figure 1.10.1)</b>.

    <p>Now we will use the controls in the Viewer

    for the 
    following functions:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Autoview: restores the display back to its default
	  condition; very useful when first viewing an object or when some
	  combination of settings results in objects disappearing from the

      <li>Set Home View: captures the setting of the current view so you
	  can return to it later by clicking the ``Go home'' 
	  button.
      <li>Go home: restores the current home view.

    <p><b><A name="section-10">Saving and reloading networks</b><br></A> 

    <p>The three-module network that we created earlier provides the
    foundation
    for the nets we create through the rest of this tutorial.  Now we
    will  
    examine how to save nets to disk and reload them in a future SCIRun
    session. 

    <p>To save a SCIRun network (<b>Figure 1.11</b>):
    <ol>
      <li value="1.">Pull down the File menu from the top of the SCIRun window.
      <li>Select &quot;Save&quot;.  
      <li>When the file browser appears, follow the prompt to choose a
	  location and filename for your net (by convention, we keep most
	  nets in the SCIRun/src/nets/ directory, but you can store them in
	  whatever location you wish). 
      <li>For this example, store the net as
	  SCIRun/src/nets/show-torso-mesh.net (we use the .net suffix for
	  SCIRun network files).
    </ol><br> 

    </div>
    <center>
    <p><img height="216" width="320" src="images/figures/1_11.gif"><br>
    <b>Figure 1.11</b></p>
    </center>
    <div align="left">
    <p><br>
    <ol>
      <li value="5.">Now exit SCIRun and restart the program.  
      <li>To load the saved net (<b>Figure 1.12</b>), pull down the
      &quot;Load...&quot; option from the File menu bar.
      <li>Select SCIRun/src/nets/show-torso-mesh.net 
    </ol><br>
    
    </div>
    <center>
    <p><img height="369" width="500" src="images/figures/1_12.gif"><br>
    <b>Figure 1.12</b></p>
    </center>
    <div align="left">
    <p><br>
    </div>
    
    <p>The net should reload into SCIRun, where it was when you saved it.   
    After changing anything in the display (<i>e.g.</i>, rotating the view
    in the Viewer Window or changing
    the rendering color of the nodes in ShowField), then there are
    two options to re-save the net:
    <ul>
      <li>Overwrite the existing show-torso-mesh.net file by simply
	  pulling down File > Save from the menu.  
      <li>Alternatively, save it to a new file using File > Save As...  
    </ul>
    
    <p>For more information on the File menu options (such as Insert and
    Clear), please refer to <a
    HREF="../Guide/usersguide/srug4.html#sec:workwithnets"> User's Guide 4.0,  
    Working with Networks</a>.
    
    <p><b><H4>Summary</b></H4>
    
    <p>In this chapter, we created a three module network to visualize the
    geometry  
    of a mesh.  We rendered that mesh to the viewing window, and practiced
    saving  
    and reloading networks.

    <p>The next chapter features additional tools to examine data values, 
    and instructions for varying colors over the geometry.
