<p class="head"><a name="ThirdParty">Third Party Software Information</a></p>
    <p class="firstpara">
      The following information may help expedite the process of
      installing the required third party software.  It is not
      intended to replace the installation instructions provided with
      the software, only to supplement them.  Please read the
      build instructions for each distribution before attempting to
      build.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      This section does not apply to the installation and upgrade of
      the OS and compilers, as those topics are quite involved.
    </p>

<p class="subhead">Installation Location of Third Party Software</p>
    <p class="firstpara">
      SCIRun can easily be used with existing instances of the
      required third party software, regardless of where it is
      installed.  However, it is recommended that all the
      required third party software be installed into a centralized and
	  out of the way location, to prevent conflicts with other software,
	  if it is not yet already installed.
    </p>
    
    <p class="firstpara">
      For example, install all the third party software into the
      directory called "/usr/local/scirun_stuff" such that
      after installing all the distributions, the /usr/local/scirun_stuff has the
      following contents:
    </p>

    <pre class="example">/usr/local/scirun_stuff/tcl8.3.2
/usr/local/scirun_stuff/tk8.3.2
/usr/local/scirun_stuff/itcl3.1.0
/usr/local/scirun_stuff/blt2.4u
/usr/local/scirun_stuff/xerces-c-src1_3_0
/usr/local/scirun_stuff/make-3.79.1
/usr/local/scirun_stuff/man
/usr/local/scirun_stuff/lib
/usr/local/scirun_stuff/bin
/usr/local/scirun_stuff/include
    </pre>

    <p class="firstpara">
      Where all the executable binaries are in the /bin directory, all
      the shared object binaries are in the /lib directory and all 
      the header files are in the /include directory.
    </p>
        
    <p class="subhead">Configure Options for Third Party Software</p>
      
    <p class="firstpara">
      The following represent the recommended configure
      commands for the indicated software distributions.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      NOTE: <i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i> represents
      the chosen installation directory for the indicated software
      distribution.  <i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i>
      would be "/usr/local/scirun_stuff" for the example given
      above. 
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      <b>For Tcl, Tk, [incr Tcl/Tk], BLT and GNU make</b>
    </p>

    <pre class="example"><font color=blue>configure --prefix=</font><i><b><font

    </pre>

    <p class="firstpara">
      <b>For Xerces-C</b>
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      On SGI machines:

		 color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i>
    </pre>

<p class="subhead">Environment Variables</p>
    <p class="firstpara">
      Once the third party software is properly installed, set or edit 
      environment variables to use those executables and libraries.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      Usually, depending on the startup shell being used, there are two
      environment variables that may need to be edited: one defining the
      search path for executables and the other defining the search path
      for libraries.  Edit (or set) those variables, for the shell being
      used, to include the third party executables located in the /bin
      directory(s) and to include the the third party libraries located
      in the /lib directory(s).
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      As before, <i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i> represents
      the chosen installation directory.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      For csh or tcsh:
    </p>

    <pre class="example">setenv PATH <i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i>/bin:$PATH</pre>
    <pre class="example">setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH <i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</pre>

    <p class="firstpara">
      For bash or ksh:
    </p>

    <pre class="example">export PATH=<i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i>/bin:$PATH</pre>
    <pre class="example">export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<i><b><font color=green>INST_DIR</font></b></i>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</pre>

    <p class="firstpara">
      Note that if the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables were not already set,
      then the trailing :$PATH and/or :$LD_LIBRARY_PATH are not needed and may
      cause the command to fail.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
      Also, for machines using rld (e.g. SGI machines) the environment 
      variable named above as LD_LIBRARY_PATH may need to changed to
      LD_LIBRARY32_PATH or LD_LIBRARY64_PATH depending upon the machine's
      default ABI (Application Binary Interface).
    </p>

<p class="head"><a name="Gotchas">Known Issues</a></p>
    <p class="firstpara">
	  This section describes known issues with installing and building SCIRun and 
	  it's required third party software.  It also includes solutions when available. 
    </p>

<p class="subhead">Path Specifications</p>
    <p class="firstpara">
	  If any of the software, SCIRun or thirdparty, is installed into a user's home
	  directory, <i><b>do not</b></i> use abbreviations such as tilde expansion
	  when specifying paths.  Instead, use full absolute paths.  For example, use
	  /home/bob/SCIRun instead of ~bob/SCIRun for the --prefix arguments when configuring.
	  Most abbreviation techniques will not get expanded by the build scripts for any of
	  the software.
    </p>

<p class="subhead">Building with 64 bit enabled on SGI</p>
    <p class="firstpara">
	  Unfortunately, most of the required third party software didn't have 64 bit SGI platforms
	  in mind when they wrote their configure scripts and makefiles.  However, it is possible
	  to build all the software in 64 bit with some effort.  In general, to get 64 bit versions
	  of the third party software it is necessarty to edit Makefiles such that the CFLAGS and LFLAGS
	  macros have "-64" listed instead of "-n32".  In the case of the tcl distributions, this
	  means editing the makefiles (after configuring) by hand and replacing all instances of 
	  "-n32" with "-64".  Getting xerces to build in 64 bits is a little more complicated: first
	  start the runConfigure script as usual, then (before making) type the export commands
	  indicated at the conclusion of the runConfigure script verbatim with the exception that you
	  insert "-64" into the CFLAGS and LFLAGS environment variables.
    </p>

<p class="subhead">Building [incr Tcl/Tk]</p>
	<p class="firstpara">
	  The [incr Tcl/Tk] distribution listed in the system requirements has a bug in it:
	  The installation scripts are bundled without execute permissions.  Before attempting
	  to configure or make [incr Tcl/Tk], type the following commands:
	</p>

	<pre class="example"><font color=blue>cd itcl3.1.0/config
chmod a+x install-sh mkinstalldirs</font></pre>

	<p class="firstpara">
	  Then, proceed normally with the configure and make.
	</p>

<p class="subhead">Building BLT</p>
	<p class="firstpara">
	  The BLT make files have bugs in them that prevent building the necessary shared object
	  libraries.  To build the necessary files type the following, after configuring:
	</p>

	<pre class="example"><font color=blue>cd blt2.4u
make 
cd src/shared
make 
cd blt2.4u
make -k install
cd src/shared
make -k install</font>
	</pre>

<p class="subhead">Building Xerces-c</p>
	<p class="firstpara">
	  The make system for Xerces-c is not standard and has many bugs.  The following all apply
	  after configuring xerces.
	</p>

	<p class="firstpara">
	  The configure scripts are bundled without execute permissions.  Before attempting
	  to configure or make Xerces-C, type the following commands:
	</p>

	<pre class="example"><font color=blue>cd xerces-c-src1_3_0/src
chmod a+x configure runConfigure</font></pre>

	<p class="firstpara">
	  Then, proceed normally with the configure and make.
	</p>

	<p class="firstpara">
	  After typing "make", but before compilation begins, the make system copies certain files around.
	  This copying is not specified in any dependancy tree, so using a -j flag (use multiple threads)
	  as a make argument will cause the build to fail.
	</p>

	<p class="firstpara">
	  There is no dependancy tree for the "install" target within the make files, so passing
	  install as an argument to the first time "make" is typed will cause the build to fail.
	  Instead type "make" first, then "make install".
	</p>

	<p class="firstpara">
	  The make system ignores errors in compilation and forces a link.  Verify that the build
	  was actually successful by checking the size of libxerces-c1_3.so.  The sizes should be:
	  ~2.1MB for SGI 32 bit, ~2.4MB for SGI 64 bit, and ~1.4MB for linux.
	</p>

	<p class="firstpara">
	  The install script the make system uses to install xerces has a bug: it copies it's
	  header files into the parent of /include rather than into /include itself.  After 
	  typing "make install", move the copied files from the parent into /include by hand.
	</p>

<p class="subhead">Building SCIRun</p>
	<p class="firstpara">
	  The configure script expects the OpenGL headers to live in /usr/include/GL or /usr/X11R6/include/GL.
	  Some linux distributions have the OpenGL headers installed in /usr/local/include/GL.  This is 
	  non-standard and should be corrected, as this may cause version conflicts with other pieces of 
	  software located in /usr/local.
	</p>

	<p class="firstpara">
	  SCIRun requires the full source of Tcl and Tk to be installed.  This is required because SCIRun
	  defines a few Tk widgets of it's own, and needs some headers from the source that aren't
	  included with typical installations.  If your system already has the correct Tcl and Tk versions
	  installed, you will have to re-install (see above) in order to have the sources included.
	</p>

	<p class="firstpara">
	  SCIRun has been successfully built on several versions of linux including Mandrake 7.2, SuSE 7.0,
	  and Debian 2.2.x (stable and unstable).  It has also been successfully installed (after much coaxing)
	  on Redhat systems.  In addition, it has been successfully installed on single and dual processor Intel
	  machines, and on single processor AMD machines.
