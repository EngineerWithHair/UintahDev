    <question>
      <p>
        Using an SGI machine I successfully built all the required thirdparty
        software by hand and successfully built SCIRun, but when I run SCIRun
        it immediately signals an abort:
      </p>
      <pre>
        Thread "main"(pid 251775) caught signal SIGABRT (Abort)
        Backtrace:

      </pre>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        One or more of the thirdparty libraries was configured and built to
        use (i.e. link against) pthreads.  On SGI machines, SCIRun uses sproc
        threads instead of pthreads.  It is illegal to use both sproc and 
        pthreads in a single process.  When two binaries are linked together
        into a single process at runtime (e.g. scirun and libxerces-c1_4.so)
        a segmentation fault is signalled and the process is
        shutdown.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution is to rebuild the offending libraries, configuring them
        to _not_ use threads.  Xerces is typically the offending library, 
        although Tcl and others may also be incorrectly configured to use
        threads.  See the <a href="InstallGuide/ThirdpartyInfo.html">Thirdparty
        Software Installation and Build Information</a> for recommended
	configure arguments for the thirdparty software.  Note that when the
	automatic install script is used that all the software is automatically
        correctly configured and built.

    <question>
      <p>
        I'm trying to build SCIRun using a Red Hat or Mandrake 8.0+ linux
	machine but the compile fails.  What's wrong?
      </p>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        Some linux distributions are shipped with a version of the GCC
        compiler (e.g. 2.96, 2.97) that doesn't work for building SCIRun. 
        For more information, please visit 
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc-2.96.html">the
        GCC site</a> that addresses this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution to this problem is to update your compiler to version
        2.95.2 or 2.95.3.

    <keywords>unable to load module, can't find symbol</keywords>
    <question>
      <p>
        When I run SCIRun, one or more of the following messages appear
        in the message window.  What is going on?
      </p>
      <pre>
        Loading package 'SCIRun'
        Unable to load module 'CastField' :
         - can't find symbol 'make_CastField'

        or

        Unable to load all of package 'Teem' (category 'DataIO' failed) :
        - libPackages_Teem_Dataflow.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
        - libPackages_Teem_Dataflow_Modules_DataIO.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

      </pre>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        Each module for a given package has it's own .xml file that 
        describes it.  When SCIRun starts, it parses all the .xml files
        in the packages (under Dataflow/XML) and tries to find the 
	matching code within the related .so files.  If the .so files cannot
        be found the message "No such file or directory" is given.  If the .so
        can be found, but the code for a particular module does not exist 
        within the library, then the message "can't find symbol" is given.
      </p>
      <p>
        The message may or may not indicate a problem.  For some modules, the
        .xml file is listed but the code has not yet been completed (this may
        be common for module developers).  For others it may mean that the
        SCIRun installation is some how corrupt (files have been deleted,
        moved, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution to this problem is to either a) build the libraries
        that the .xml files need, or b) remove the offending .xml files.

    <question>
      <p>
        When I compile SCIRun I get the following warning, and the
        build fails.  What is wrong:
      </p>
      <pre>
        ...
        Warning: Option 'std' not in group 'LANG' (LANG:std)
        ...
      </pre>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        The MIPSpro compiler on your target install machine is too old.
        SCIRun requires version 7.3.1.1m at a minimum.
