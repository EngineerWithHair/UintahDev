    <keywords>unable to load module, can't find symbol</keywords>
    <question>
      <p>
        When I run SCIRun, one or more messages appear in the message
        window indicating a problem with a package and/or module.
      </p>
      <p>
        The message(s) is/are similar to the following:
      </p>
      <pre>
        Loading package 'SCIRun'
        Unable to load module 'CastField' :
         - can't find symbol 'make_CastField'

        or

        Unable to load all of package 'Teem' (category 'DataIO' failed) :
        - libPackages_Teem_Dataflow.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
        - libPackages_Teem_Dataflow_Modules_DataIO.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
      </pre>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        Each module for a given package has it's own .xml file that 
        describes it.  When SCIRun starts, it parses all the .xml files
        in the packages (under Dataflow/XML) and tries to find the 
	matching code within the related .so files.  If the .so files cannot
        be found the message "No such file or directory" is given.  If the .so
        can be found, but the code for a particular module does not exist 
        within the library, then the message "can't find symbol" is given.
      </p>
      <p>
        The message(s) may or may not indicate a problem with SCIRun. 
        For some modules, the
        .xml file may be listed but the code has not yet been
	completed (this may
        be common for module developers).  For others it may mean that the
        SCIRun installation is some how corrupt (.so files have been deleted,
        moved, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution to this problem is to either a) build the libraries
        that the .xml files need, or b) remove the offending .xml files.
