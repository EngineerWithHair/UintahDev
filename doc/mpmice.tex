\subsection{Examples}

\section*{\center Mach 2 Wedge}
\subsection*{\underline{Problem Description}}
This is a simulation of a symmetric $20^o$ wedge traveling through initially
quiescent air at Mach 2.0.  A shock forms at the leading edge of the
wedge and an expansion fan over its top.  Consultation of oblique shock
tables, e.g.~\cite{Saad} (pp.308-309) reveals that the angle of the leading
shock compares quite well with the expected value.  In addition, this
simulation demonstrates a few other useful features of the fluid-structure
interaction capability.  In this case, the structure is rigid, and as
such, essentially provides a boundary condition to the compressible flow
calculation.  Furthermore, the geometry of the wedge is described via a
triangulated surface, rather than the geometric primitives usually used.
This allows the user to study flow around arbitrarily complex objects,
without the difficulty of generating a body fitted mesh around that object.

Figure~\ref{figwedge} shows a snapshot of the simulation.  Contour
plot depicts pressure and reflects the presence of a leading shock
and an expansion fan.
