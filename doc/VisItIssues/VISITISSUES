Issues with VisIt visualization software will inevitably arise in day to day use.
Herein exist the issues known when using VisIt on uda's created with sus.

The general format that should be adopted for documenting such an issue is as 
follows:

a) Date reported
b) Visit Version

VisIt will sometime complain that a number of data blocks are missing and has
inserted 0's to compensate.  This results missing portions of the plot.
The issue occurs when plotting a large number of different variable in a display.  
It occurs when visualizing particle data, such as p.x or p.crackRad or p.velocity,
as a "Pseudocolor Plot" with the "Transform" operator applied.  

The typical error may be: "The compute engine running on host localhost issued the 
following warning: In domain 0, your zonal variable "press_CC/0" has 400 values, 
but it should have 0.  Some values were removed to ensure VisIt runs smoothly."

As you may note, the visual artifacts do not occur in the press_CC plot, but rather in
the p.crackRad.
