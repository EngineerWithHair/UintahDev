Subject: [Bug 555] New: README file in Thirdparty incomplete
X-Bugzilla-Reason: AssignedTo

           Summary: README file in Thirdparty incomplete
           Product: SCIRun
           Version: 1.8.0
          Platform: SGI
        OS/Version: IRIX
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: P2
         Component: Documentation
        AssignedTo: dustman@cvrti.utah.edu
        ReportedBy: macleod@cvrti.utah.edu


The README file in the thirdparty directory of 1.8 is not complete nor 
helpful for installation:

You must have at least version 1.5.2 python to use the install script.

 Usage: <path> [bits] [jobs]


 - <path>     : path to top of your installation 
 - [bits]     : make a 32 bit or 64 bit build. 32 is default.
 - [jobs]     : an integer to be passed to gmake (-j NUM_JOBS).
                defaults to 2.

You may now reinstall, by re-running the the same command line as your 
first attempt.  You will then be prompted to decide to reinstall all of 
the targets. If you enter y to do so, the previous installation will be
deleted, and the new installation will be built there.  

If you want to reinstall selected packages only, enter n to the
reinstall all prompt, and you will be asked package by package which
ones to reinstall. For each package that you select, install will
delete the previous installation and reinstall from the distribution.

If any of the commands to install fail (i.e. one of the makes for a
third party package fails) install will exit.

------------------------------------------------------------------

It should read more like the installation guide, which describes the actual 
command required for making the libraries.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the third party installation script: 


python install dir 32|64 jobs

where dir is the directory in which the third-party software will be installed 
(although it is actually installed in a sub-directory of the specified one), 32|
64 specifies one of 32 bit or 64 bit binaries, and jobs is the number of 
jobs that make will create when building the software. For example: 


python install /usr/local/SCIRun_Third_Party 64 2

or 


python install /usr/local/SCIRun_Third_Party 32 1

When finished, the installation script will display the complete name of 
the third-party software installation directory—make note of this value. 


Note
The name of the third-party installation directory reflects the parameters 
given to the install script. This allows you to maintain multiple third-party 
installations for different operating systems and machine architectures. 

You may reinstall part or all of the third-party software by repeating the 
previous command. You will be asked to replace all or part of the 
installation. Just answer y or n to the script until you have selected the 
exact reinstallation you wish.
