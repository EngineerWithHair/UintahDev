<title>Thirdparty Software Installation and Build Information</title>

<section>
<para>
This chapter may help expedite installation of the
required third party software. However, this information is not
intended to replace the installation instructions that come with
the software, but to supplement them. Please read the install
instructions for each software distribution before attempting to
use this information. 
</para> 
</section>

<section>
<title>Prerequisites</title>
<para>
Use of this document requires experience with the SGI Irix 
operating system and/or the Linux operating system. Knowledge of
file systems, programming in C/C++, building software from
tarball distributions and shell scripting will be useful, if not
required. The installation or upgrade of core system components
(such as the OS and compilers) may be required. As such, a
system administrator's assistance may be needed. 
</para> 

<para>
This document does not address the installation and upgrade of
the OS and build tools as those topics are quite involved.
</para>

<section>
<title>Automatic Installation of All Thirdparty Software</title>

<para>
Because of many bugs and &quot;gotchas&quot; you would encounter if
you installed the required thirdparty software its installation has
been automated via the SCI Institute's thirdparty install script.  The
automatic install script comes with all the necessary thirdparty
software, and does not require additional downloads.</para>

<para>
To use the automatic install script do the following: 
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Download the install script tar ball from <ulink url="http://software.sci.utah.edu/archive_entry.html">here</ulink>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Put the tar ball into a directory of your choosing.
</para>

<para>
Unzip and untar the tar ball:
</para>

<literallayout>
gunzip Thirdparty_install.<replaceable>x.x.x</replaceable>.tar.gz
tar xvf Thirdparty_install.<replaceable>x.x.x</replaceable>.tar
cd Thirdparty_install.<replaceable>x.x.x</replaceable>
</literallayout>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The install script is designed to help organize multiple installations
for different architectures or compilers.  Run the install script by
typing:
</para>

<literallayout>
python install <replaceable>base-path</replaceable>
<replaceable>architecture</replaceable> <replaceable>compiler
bit-size</replaceable>
</literallayout>

<para>
Like this for: 32 bit binaries, on Linux, with a gcc 3.0.4 compiler,
installed to /usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty :
</para>

<literallayout>
python install /usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty Linux gcc-3.0.4 32
</literallayout>

<para>
Your installation would then be under
/usr/local/SCIRun_Thirdparty/Linux/gcc-3.0.4-32bit
</para>

<para>
You can also specify a faster parallel build by giving an integer
which provides the "number of jobs" argument for GNU make For
example,to build 32 bit binaries and libraries using 12 jobs, type the
following: </para>

<literallayout>
python install 32 12
</literallayout>

<para>
When the install script finishes, it will display a message regarding
the <option>--with-thirdparty</option> SCIRun configure option.  Cut
and paste that option when running the configure command for SCIRun.
</para>

<para>
The install script requires Python version 1.5.2 or greater.
</para>

<para>
You may reinstall part or all of the required thirdparty software by
repeating the above command.  This time since the target directory
exists, you will be asked to replace all or part of the
installation. Just answer y or n to the script until you have selected
the exact reinstallation you wish.  </para>
